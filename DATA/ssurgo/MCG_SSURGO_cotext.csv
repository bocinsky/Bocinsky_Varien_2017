The parent material consists of eolian deposits derived from sandstone and shale and/or residuum weathered from sandstone and shale. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately low.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is high.  Shrink-swell potential is high. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 2 percent. This component is in the R048AY234CO Mountain Clay ecological site. Nonirrigated land capability classification is 4e. Irrigated land capability classification is 4e. This soil does not meet hydric criteria. The calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 20 percent.  ",17724381,17694586

The parent material consists of eolian deposits derived from sandstone. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately high.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is high.  Shrink-swell potential is moderate. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 85 percent. Below this thin organic horizon the organic matter content is about 3 percent. This component is in the R048AY228CO Mountain Loam ecological site. Nonirrigated land capability classification is 4e. Irrigated land capability classification is 4e. This soil does not meet hydric criteria. The calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 3 percent. There are no saline horizons within 30 inches of the soil surface. ",17724385,17694590
