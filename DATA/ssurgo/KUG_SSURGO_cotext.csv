09/14/2015 00:00:00,Nontechnical description,GENSOIL,generated,"The Cahona component makes up 40 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 6 to 12 percent. This component is on hills, mesas. The parent material consists of eolian deposits derived from sandstone. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately high.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is high.  Shrink-swell potential is low. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 1 percent. This component is in the R036XY284CO Loamy Foothills ecological site. Nonirrigated land capability classification is 4e. Irrigated land capability classification is 4e. This soil does not meet hydric criteria. The calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 33 percent. There are no saline horizons within 30 inches of the soil surface. The soil has a maximum sodium adsorption ratio of 2 within 30 inches of the soil surface.",17724562,17694769
