09/14/2015 00:00:00,Nontechnical description,GENSOIL,generated,"The Ackmen component makes up 90 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 3 to 6 percent. This component is on draws, drainageways, flood plains. The parent material consists of alluvium derived from mixed. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately high.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is high.  Shrink-swell potential is low. This soil is rarely flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 4 percent. This component is in the R036XY405CO Loamy Bottom (ghost) ecological site. Nonirrigated land capability classification is 3e. Irrigated land capability classification is 3e. This soil does not meet hydric criteria. The calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 3 percent. There are no saline horizons within 30 inches of the soil surface. ",17724266,17694471
